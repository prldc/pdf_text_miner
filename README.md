# pdf_text_miner
* Mines text from PDFs for text analysis. Uses OCR automatically if needed. 
* Creates .txt files from PDFs and stores the extracted text in a spreadsheet for further use.
* Because the project uses OCR, you have to first install Google Tesseract OCR (instructions can be found here: https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract).
